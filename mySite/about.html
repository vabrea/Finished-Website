        <h3><b>Introduction</b></h3>
        <p>I was born and raised in Oxnard, CA and currently reside in Ventura, CA. I have always have been into tech, but have never made the effort to go out and learn. My family always turned to me when it came to fixing the computers, routers, or toubleshooting various electronic devices around the hours. I always have enjoyed it, so I set out to learn more about and ended up here at <b><u>SDGKU!</u></b> I am an Air Force veteran and most of my experience comes is in a Financial background. I have zero to little coding experience, except Myspace... <i>(which is probably why HTML feels familiar and I can kind of remember some of it lol)</i> I hope to begin a new career with everything I am able to learn and practice in the FSDI course - I am looking forward to the class.</p>

        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I served about 8 years in the US Air Force and worked in Finance the whole time. I currently work for an Global HR consulting firm under the Payroll and Accounting team. I have a Bachelor's, Master's, and was working towards an <del>MBA.</del> Being outdoors is one of my favorite hobbies and when the weather permits, getting out to the mountains to snowboard. In the summertime you can find me at the beach hanging with my friends. If I am not there... you can find me at the bar.. loll. Love to have fun, love to hang out, and always trying to learn new things!</p>
